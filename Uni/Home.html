					<tr>

						<td rowspan="7"><p>In my first year of university I learnt c#, I learnt how to use Visual studios and how to use Unity.  I learnt the basics and the fundamentals of programming. I got a better understanding of Computer architecture and how things work and why they are important in computers.  With these tools I created many applications over the year and paved the way for me now.</p>
						<p>I created many projects throughout my first year but here are a few, the first project was a Dice game, where the player rolled 5 dice and had to get 3, 4 or 5 of them the same to earn points. This game could either be played with people or against an AI I created.  This game was created to show my understanding of programming and data structures.</p>
						<p>Another project I created was a 2D dungeon game, this game had 3 levels and was created in Unity.  The player had a training level and then 2 real levels with the last being a boss battle.  This game was created to show my level of understanding within the games programming module.</p>
						<p>I also created a word application that would look at how many vowels and consonants there are in a block of text. You could either use a prewritten piece of text for example a paragraph from a harry potter book or create a piece of text on the fly. The text you created also had a system built in that allowed you to save the text, name the text file and choose where the text file was going n to be saved.  This was also created for my programming and data structures module.</p>

						<p>In my second year of university I learnt how to use C++, I learnt how to use OpenGL and OpenCL. We had an in depth look into the world of AI.  I participated in a Group project.  I underwent a Professional Practice module that has helped me massively with interviews and my CV and Covering letter skills.  We also had a more advanced version of the games programming and studies modules from first year.  We had my favourite module and the module that has impacted me the most which was the Object-Oriented Programming module as this has set the groundwork for me and how I program from that day onwards.</p>
						<p>I created a two pong clones in OpenGL for a graphics module. One was in 2D and the other was in 3D. They were very similar but also very different at the same time as they involved different Collison detection systems and the 3D version allowed the user to move the camera around the world.</p>
						<p>I was involved in a group project where we created a 80’s style game based on the university and the university lifestyle. This was with 5 people and we all had different roles within the group, I was mainly in charge of the art but also looked at programming as we all had to do some. We all helped and pitched ideas where we thought appropriate and the project was a mixture of everyone’s ides and came out well.</p>
						<p>I created a image manipulation tool that allowed the user to re-size images how they wanted, it allowed them to change the sizing of the image, It merged a set of images into one but you got to  choose which way you wanted to do this as there was multiple ways you could do it for different results in the image.</p>
						<p>I also created a shortest path application that would allow you to choose point a and point B, this would then work out the shortest path from point a to point b then show you the path. This system is very similar to how google do their shortest path systems. I also created many AI system that had problems and a set of rules and the AI could overcome the tasks given to it.</p>

				<table style="width:100%">
					<tr>
						<td  style = "width: 50%">Physics Simulation</td>
						<td  rowspan="7">
						<p>In my third year I learnt MATLAB and the MATLAB interface. I broadened my knowledge of computer science more by picking topics I wanted to learn about which were Image processing and parallel computing. I learnt how to use p-physics more within games, I learnt how games are using physics as well within their games. I learnt how to create a multiplayer game and how to allow players to join a network, I also learnt how to create a better AI system within the games I was creating. Finally, I learnt how to create a procedurally generated world.</p>
						<p>In my final year I created only a few projects as I was mainly focused on my final year project. The first project we are going to talk about was my Physics based game.  This game was created in OpenGL used PhysX for the physics engine. This allowed me to manipulate things much easier, such as weight and how things are affected by other forces such as gravity and a pushing force in the game.</p>
						<p>I created a multiplayer Space game that allowed the player to fly around and shoot enemy ships the enemy ships were mainly AI, but you can have Player controlled ships as your friends could join the game. This was my first Multiplayer game and it was probably one of the most challenging things I have done at university.</p>
						<p>I created a Procedural world where the game is different almost every time, I say almost as the procedural generation is limited, so some things are similar but in most cases the game is different in some aspects every time and I believe it will be very hard to get a level that is exactly the same as the one before.</p>
						<p>Finally, the last project I did at university was my Final year project, for this project I created a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Image Classification. I had never done anything like this before, so I knew I had to put a lot of work in to get it done and I did.  I created a DNN that could tell the difference between certain animals.  These images were gathered from a Database specific for DNN projects and the training images and the testing images were all different, so there was no cheating.</p>
